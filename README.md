# Quick Select

Ever had a long list that needed to be marked Yes / No and you wanted to do it faster than Excel?

Well, here's your chance: https://captnemo.in/quick-list-select/

Controls:

1. Paste your List (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)
2. :right_arrow: to select an item
3. :left_arrow: to skip an item
4. spacebar to copy the entire copied list

Why would you use this?

1. Your friendlist from Facebook, but your house fits only 10 for the Zombie Apocalypse
2. Filtering down a list of cards that you are printing for your homebrew set of Cards against Humanity
3. You are going out for a picnic, but the HR said only 30 people.
4. Your homebrew version for mechanical turk
5. Trimming down your To-Read or To-Watch list from Goodreads or Netflix.
6. File a PR and tell me more!
